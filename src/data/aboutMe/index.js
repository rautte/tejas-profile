    `I am a software engineer focused on data platforms and backend systems. Most of my experience has been in building and operating distributed pipelines, backend services, and cloud infrastructure that need to run reliably at scale. I spend a lot of time thinking about how systems behave in production and how to make them predictable, observable, and easy to operate.`,
    `In my work, I have owned parts of data ingestion, processing, and orchestration pipelines across AWS and Azure. I am comfortable working close to storage, compute, and data flows, and I enjoy problems where performance, correctness, and system design all matter. I care about clean interfaces, clear ownership, and systems that fail in understandable ways.`,
    `Outside of my day-to-day roles, I build systems to deepen my understanding of infrastructure and orchestration. These projects often start from real problems and turn into tools or platforms that emphasize automation, reliability, and end-to-end ownership. I enjoy taking ideas from a rough concept to something that feels production-ready.`,
    `I am drawn to teams that value thoughtful engineering, strong fundamentals, and long-term system health. I am looking for roles where I can contribute to core data or infrastructure platforms while continuing to grow as an engineer alongside people who take their work seriously.`,
